Add a tiled text box

You've created your basic dashboard to combine all of the share volume and share price information for the stocks in your portfolio. Now you'll customize it with a title in a text box, then remove redundant text to use space more efficiently.

    In the "Stocks" dashboard, add a tiled text box with the text "My investments" to the top of the dashboard.
    Remove the titles of the four stock visualizations.

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 4_6_Add_a_tiled_text_box.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.

Expected plot

What is the title of the dialog box that pops up when you drag the tiled text box onto the dashboard?
Edit Text


Hint

    Ensure you are in the "Stocks" dashboard.
    Under "Objects", ensure "Tiled" is selected then drag and drop a "Text" object to the top of the dashboard.
    Write "My investments" in the text box.
    In the "Stocks" dashboard, double-click each stock's visualization title, then delete the plot title text.
    Adjust the size of the tiles in the dashboard so the plots are the same size roughly and the text box has little surrounding white space.
