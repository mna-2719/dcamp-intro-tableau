Segmenting by room type

Now it's your turn to segment data. Previously, you found the average price of rooms in each neighborhood. Now, you want to know the average number of days listings were occupied in 2019 segmented first by neighborhood, but also by room type.

    Remove Price from the Marks field.
    Drag Days Occupied In 2019 to the Text Marks card, and get the average instead of the sum.
    Segment by Room Type.

If you lost progress, load the workbook 1_3_Segmenting_by_room_type.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.
