My investments

Sometimes the stories you tell will be longer. In this exercise, you'll create a detailed, six-point story that narrates your investment journey in 2018 only.

Apply a date filter to the "Facebook", "Tesco", "TD Bank", "Toyota", "Currency", and "Portfolio Value" worksheets so there is only 2018 data.
    Create a new story called named "My 2018 investments".
    Add the above six worksheets in the above order.
    Write detailed captions that tell your 2018 investing highlights.
    Enter presentation mode.

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 4_12_My_investments.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.
