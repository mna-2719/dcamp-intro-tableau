My investments

Sometimes the stories you tell will be longer.
In this exercise, you'll create a detailed, six-point story that narrates your investment journey in 2018 only.

Apply a date filter to the "Facebook", "Tesco", "TD Bank", "Toyota", "Currency", and "Portfolio Value" worksheets so there is only 2018 data.
   Create a new story called named "My 2018 investments".
    Add the above six worksheets in the above order.
    Write detailed captions that tell your 2018 investing highlights.
    Enter presentation mode.
