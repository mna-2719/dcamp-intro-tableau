Tailor your captions

In the last exercise, you combined two dashboards ("Stocks" and "Currency and Value") into a short, two-point story conveys a lot of information. In this exercise, you'll improve upon those captions to highlight a specific insight in each story point. You'll also remove a redundant part of a dashboard in the story.

    Add detail to the "Stocks" caption so it tells a story about your investing journey.
    Add detail to the "Currency and Value" caption so it tells a story about your investing journey.
    Go to the "Stocks" dashboard and delete the text button that says "View currency fluctuations".

When you hover over a story caption, several buttons become available. Hover over the leftmost button. What is the name of that button?
Delete
