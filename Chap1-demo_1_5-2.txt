Bringing it all together

To close this first chapter, you're going to build a whole visualization on your own, from scratch. You're going to compare occupancy and average prices for each combination of neighborhood and room type: this would be excellent information to decide where an investment might be interesting.

    Clear the sheet.
    Drag the neighborhoods to the Rows field.
    Segment by room type.
    Drag the measure Price onto the Text card, and select the average instead of the sum.
    Build a stacked bar.
    Drag the Price measure onto the Label card and select the average instead of the sum.

If you don't see the Show Me button, that's because your window is too small. In Tableau, the Show Me button will appear or disappear from the toolbar depending on the size of the application window. You can make it appear by:

    pressing Ctrl + 1 (the number one, not the letter L)
    making your browser full screen
    reducing the size of this left pane by dragging it to the left

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 1_6_Bringing_it_all_together.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.
