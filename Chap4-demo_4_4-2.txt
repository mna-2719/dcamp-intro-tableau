Add floating images and a button

Now you'll further customize that dashboard. In this exercise, you'll use visuals (images of flags) to emphasize the information you're trying to communicate (currency type). Too much text on a plot can be distracting. Here, you protect against that.

    In the "Stocks" dashboard, add a floating image to each plot, one for each flag of the country in which that stock's stock exchange is listed.
    Add a floating button to the dashboard that says "View currency fluctuations" that redirects to the "Currency" worksheet.

What is the title of the dialog box that pops up when you drag the floating image object onto the dashboard?
