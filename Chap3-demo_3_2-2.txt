World population

Let's combine everything you've learned so far! In this final exercise, you will be creating a symbol map that will make it easy to look at the countries' population and population growth rate. With this information, the World Health Organization can decide on which countries they need to focus to prevent health risks due to overpopulation. You will be able to answer the question introduced before:

    What was the population growth of the country with the highest population in 2008?

To build this map you need to:

    Load the 3_3_World_population.twbx workbook (located in the Workbooks folder on the Desktop).
    Create a symbol map with varying circle sizes based on Population.
    Color the circles based on average Population Growth.
    Add a black border around the circles and remove the halo.
    Filter the data on year to include data for 2008.

Looking at your map, you should be able to answer the following question.


What was the population growth of the country with the highest population in 2008?
0.56
