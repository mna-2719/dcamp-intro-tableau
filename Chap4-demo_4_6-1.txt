Tailor your captions

In the last exercise, you combined two dashboards ("Stocks" and "Currency and Value") into a short, two-point story conveys a lot of information. In this exercise, you'll improve upon those captions to highlight a specific insight in each story point. You'll also remove a redundant part of a dashboard in the story.

    Add detail to the "Stocks" caption so it tells a story about your investing journey.
    Add detail to the "Currency and Value" caption so it tells a story about your investing journey.
    Go to the "Stocks" dashboard and delete the text button that says "View currency fluctuations".

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 4_10_Tailor_your_captions.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.

Expected plot

When you hover over a story caption, several buttons become available. Hover over the leftmost button. What is the name of that button?
Delete

Hint

    Click the first story point caption and replace the text with something like "I invest internationally".
    Click the second story point caption and replace the text with something like "And monitor currency fluctuations".
    At the bottom of the workbook, click the "Stocks" dashboard tab.
    Select the text button that says "View currency fluctuations" and click the "X" to delete it.
