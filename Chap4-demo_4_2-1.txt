Use tooltips

In this exercise, you'll create the same plot as in the previous demos and exercises, but for Tesco. You'll modify the tooltip so you remind yourself of Tesco's legendary marketing slogan and its success: "Every little helps".

    In a new worksheet titled "Tesco", create a combined area and line plot with date (day) on the x-axis, TSCO.L Shares on the left y-axis as an area plot, and TSCO.L Price on the right y-axis as a line plot.
    Make the plots grey.
    Add a new line to the top of the tooltip that says "Every little helps" in bold italics.

If you don't see the Show Me button, that's because your window is too small. In Tableau, the Show Me button will appear or disappear from the toolbar depending on the size of the application window. You can make it appear by:

    pressing Ctrl + 1 (the number one, not the letter L)
    making your browser full screen
    reducing the size of this left pane by dragging it to the left

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 4_2_Use_tooltips.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.
