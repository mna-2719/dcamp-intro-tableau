Use readable fonts

In the previous exercise, you created a plot for TD Bank that monitors the price of the stock and how many shares of it that you own. In this exercise, you'll create the same plot but for Facebook and edit the font so it matches the font Facebook uses on its website.

    In a new worksheet titled "Facebook", create a combined area and line plot with date (day) on the x-axis, FB Shares on the left y-axis as an area plot, and FB Price on the right y-axis as a line plot.
    Change the font of the Facebook worksheet to Segoe UI.
