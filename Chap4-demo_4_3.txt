Creating a dashboard

You've already created your views to monitor share volume and share price for all four stocks you own. Now, you'll create a dashboard to combine them so you can consume all of that information at once instead of having to click individual worksheets.

    Create a new dashboard named "Stocks".
    Drag the "Facebook", "TD Bank", "Tesco", and "Toyota" sheets into the dashboard, stacking them vertically.
    Right click the x-axis for the top three plots and uncheck "Show Header" so the x-axis is displayed for the bottom plot only.

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 4_5_Create_a_dashboard.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.

Hint

    At the bottom of the workbook, click the "New Dashboard" icon.
    Right-click the new tab that appears and click "Rename" then name it "Stocks".
    From the "Sheets" list at left, drag the "Facebook", "TD Bank", "Tesco", and "Toyota" views to the dashboard at the right, stacking them vertically.
    Right click the x-axis for "Facebook", "TD Bank", and "Tesco" and uncheck "Show Header".
    Click each view in the dashboard, then hover over its top or bottom border to adjust its height. Make the data in all views visible and roughly the same size by dragging the borders.
