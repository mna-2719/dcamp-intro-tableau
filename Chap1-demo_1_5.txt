Improving your first visualization

Your visualization is insightful, but having the numbers appear directly on the graph instead of having to hover over each bar would make things easier.

    Add labels to show the Days Occupied In 2019 on average for each room type in each neighborhood.

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 1_5_Improving_your_first_visualization.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.


Which neighborhood shows 315 days occupancy in 2019 on average for shared rooms?
