To build this table you need to:

    Use a quick table calculation to add the percent difference (compared to the previous year) of Stomach Cancer cases as values in the table.
    Color the cell background based on this value.
    Also show the original values of Stomach Cancer cases in each year.
    Change the order and show the original values above the calculated values.

Looking at this table, you should be able to answer the following question.

What is the biggest percentage drop in stomach cancer cases compared to the previous year? Round your answer to the third decimal.
