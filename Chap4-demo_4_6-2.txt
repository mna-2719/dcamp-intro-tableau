Adjust layout

In the last exercise, augmented your story with detailed captions.
You don't always need those captions, though! If you want a minimal story that you'll walk people through in a verbal presentation, you can adjust the layout to hide those captions. In this exercise, you'll do that.

    Make the layout "Numbers".
    Enter "Presentation Mode".

What is the name of the navigator style layout option directly below "Numbers"?
Dots
