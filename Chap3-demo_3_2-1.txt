More symbol map options

Let's add some color to this map. You are asked to add some information about the population growth of the countries. To make the map more clear, you decide to add the coastline.

To build this map you need to:

    Color the circles based on the average Population Growth.
    Add a black border around the circles.
    Remove the halo.
    Add a Map layer responsible for showing the Coastline.

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 3_2_More_symbol_map_options.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.

Looking at your map, you should be able to answer the following question.

Was the population growth of the United Kingdom positive or negative?
