Creating a dashboard

You've already created your views to monitor share volume and share price for all four stocks you own. Now, you'll create a dashboard to combine them so you can consume all of that information at once instead of having to click individual worksheets.

    Create a new dashboard named "Stocks".
    Drag the "Facebook", "TD Bank", "Tesco", and "Toyota" sheets into the dashboard, stacking them vertically.
    Right click the x-axis for the top three plots and uncheck "Show Header" so the x-axis is displayed for the bottom plot only.

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 4_5_Create_a_dashboard.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.

Expected plot

What is the button directly above the "Show Header" button?
