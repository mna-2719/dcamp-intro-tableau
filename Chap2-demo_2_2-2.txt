Top filters on Tableau

Now, we want to filter countries on their average Cell Phones per 100 people across the years 2006-2015. The sum aggregation is set as the default aggregation for measures, so you'll have to look out for this.

    Load the 2_4_Top_filters_on_Tableau.twbx workbook (located in the Workbooks folder on the Desktop).
    Use Tableau's top filter option to answer the following question. Make sure to change the aggregation from sum!


Which country has the second lowest Cell Phones per 100 people average?
