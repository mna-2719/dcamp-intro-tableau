Currency and value

You own four stocks, all denominated in different currencies. Now, you'll create a dashboard that displays the total value of your holdings in USD (share price multiplied by share volume, then converted to USD using the exchange rate), alongside the "Currency" view you've already created. In this dashboard, you can get a feeling for how your portfolio behaves amidst currency fluctuations.

    Create a new worksheet named "Portfolio Value".
    Create a calculated field called Total Value (USD) that multiplies share price by share volume by the appropriate exchange rate factor for all stocks then adds the products together.
    Create an area plot with date on the x-axis and the new calculated field on the y-axis.
    Create a new dashboard named "Currency and Value".
    Add the "Currency" sheet and the "Portfolio Value" sheet to the dashboard.
    Add a floating image with the US flag under the area plot title.
