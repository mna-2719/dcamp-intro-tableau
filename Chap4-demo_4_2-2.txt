Adjust axes as necessary

In this exercise, you'll create the same plot as in the previous demos and exercises, but for Toyota. You'll modify secondary y-axis so you remind yourself of the currency that the Toyota stock is denominated in (Japanese yen).

    In a new worksheet titled "Toyota", create a combined area and line plot with date (day) on the x-axis, 7203.T Shares on the left y-axis as an area plot, and 7203.T Price on the right y-axis as a line plot.
    Make the plots red to match Toyota's brand.
    Add " (JPY)" to the end of the "7203.T Price" axis label.
