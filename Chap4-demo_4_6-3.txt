My investments

Sometimes the stories you tell will be longer. In this exercise, you'll create a detailed, six-point story that narrates your investment journey in 2018 only.

    Apply a date filter to the "Facebook", "Tesco", "TD Bank", "Toyota", "Currency", and "Portfolio Value" worksheets so there is only 2018 data.
    Create a new story called named "My 2018 investments".
    Add the above six worksheets in the above order.
    Write detailed captions that tell your 2018 investing highlights.
    Enter presentation mode.

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 4_12_My_investments.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.

You held Tesco for pretty much all of 2018. How many shares did you have for the majority of the year?
200

Hint

    Click the "Facebook" tab. Drag the Date dimension to the Filter card. Select Years then 2018.
    Do the same for the "Tesco", "TD Bank", "Toyota", "Currency", and "Portfolio Value" worksheets.
    At the bottom, click the "New Story" icon.
    Right-click the new story and rename it "My 2018 investments".
    In the left panel, double-click the "Facebook", "Tesco", "TD Bank", "Toyota", "Currency", and "Portfolio Value" sheets in that order.
    Write detailed captions, like the following:
    I bought early and Facebook dove
    I held Tesco all year and it was a roller coaster ride
    I bought early and TD fluctuated, then dove late
    Toyota steadily decreased while I steadily bought
    The US dollar was strong, which wasn't great for my foreign investments
    My portfolio value dropped in the second half of the year despite my continual buys
    Click the "Presentation Mode" icon near the top-right corner of the interface (or click F7).
