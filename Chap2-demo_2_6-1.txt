Average across age groups and gender

In the demo, we created a field for the average across men age groups. Now, you will create a field for the average across women and men age groups.

    Load the 2_6_Mean_across_age_groups_and_gender.twbx workbook (located in the Workbooks folder on the Desktop).
    Create a new field called All that aggregates the 10 demographics across age groups and gender.

Once you have created All, you should be able to answer the following question.

What is the highest "All" average for a country (rounded by one decimal points)?
