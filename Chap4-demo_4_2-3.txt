Monitor currency

You own four stocks, all denominated in different currencies. To monitor the value of your investments, it'd be helpful to have a plot that monitors the value of those currencies. In this exercise, you'll create a line plot that plots the value of all three non-USD currencies (that is, GBP, CAD, and JPY).

    In a new worksheet titled "Currency", create line plot with date (day) on the x-axis, then Fxcadusd, Fxgbpusd, and Fxjpyusd on the y-axis.
    Change the color of Fxcadusd to hex FF0000 to match the Canadian flag.
    Change the color of Fxgbpusd to hex 001F7E to match the flag of Great Britain.
    Change the color of Fxjpyusd to hex C70025 to match the Japanese flag.
    Adjust the date axis so its major tick marks have a fixed interval of 1 year.
    Adjust the tooltip so it has date first, then "1 CAD is worth (plus the other non-USD currencies).
    Rename the titles of all views in the workbook so they are memorable.

If you don't see the Show Me button, that's because your window is too small. In Tableau, the Show Me button will appear or disappear from the toolbar depending on the size of the application window. You can make it appear by:

    pressing Ctrl + 1 (the number one, not the letter L)
    making your browser full screen
    reducing the size of this left pane by dragging it to the left

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 4_4_Monitor_currency.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.
