Add a tiled text box

You've created your basic dashboard to combine all of the share volume and share price information for the stocks in your portfolio. Now you'll customize it with a title in a text box, then remove redundant text to use space more efficiently.

    In the "Stocks" dashboard, add a tiled text box with the text "My investments" to the top of the dashboard.
    Remove the titles of the four stock visualizations.

What is the title of the dialog box that pops up when you drag the tiled text box onto the dashboard?
