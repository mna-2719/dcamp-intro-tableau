Your first symbol map

Now it's your turn! Let's start building a symbol map that you can present to the World Health Organization. Your first task is to create a symbol map that displays the cases of stomach cancer worldwide. Below you can see what your result should look like.

To build this map you need to:

    Load the 3_1_Your_first_symbol_map.twbx workbook (located in the Workbooks folder on the Desktop).
    Initialize a symbol map with a circle in each country.
    Adjust the sizes of the circles based on the country's number of Stomach Cancer cases.
    Increase the size of the circles to make it easier to read the map.

Looking at your map, you should be able to answer the following question.

How many people were diagnosed with stomach cancer in the country with the highest stomach cancer cases?
7224000
