Use readable fonts

In the previous exercise, you created a plot for TD Bank that monitors the price of the stock and how many shares of it that you own. In this exercise, you'll create the same plot but for Facebook and edit the font so it matches the font Facebook uses on its website.

    In a new worksheet titled "Facebook", create a combined area and line plot with date (day) on the x-axis, FB Shares on the left y-axis as an area plot, and FB Price on the right y-axis as a line plot.
    Change the font of the Facebook worksheet to Segoe UI.

If you don't see the Show Me button, that's because your window is too small. In Tableau, the Show Me button will appear or disappear from the toolbar depending on the size of the application window. You can make it appear by:

    pressing Ctrl + 1 (the number one, not the letter L)
    making your browser full screen
    reducing the size of this left pane by dragging it to the left

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 4_1_Use_readable_fonts.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.
