Adjust layout

In the last exercise, augmented your story with detailed captions. You don't always need those captions, though! If you want a minimal story that you'll walk people through in a verbal presentation, you can adjust the layout to hide those captions. In this exercise, you'll do that.

    Make the layout "Numbers".
    Enter "Presentation Mode".

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 4_11_Adjust_layout.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.

Expected plot

    Click the "Presentation Mode" icon near the top-right corner of the interface (or click F7).
