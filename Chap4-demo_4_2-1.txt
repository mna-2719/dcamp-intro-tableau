Use tooltips

In this exercise, you'll create the same plot as in the previous demos and exercises, but for Tesco. You'll modify the tooltip so you remind yourself of Tesco's legendary marketing slogan and its success: "Every little helps".

    In a new worksheet titled "Tesco", create a combined area and line plot with date (day) on the x-axis, TSCO.L Shares on the left y-axis as an area plot, and TSCO.L Price on the right y-axis as a line plot.
    Make the plots grey.
    Add a new line to the top of the tooltip that says "Every little helps" in bold italics.
