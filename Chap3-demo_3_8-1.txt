Trend lines

Next, you are asked to investigate the trend in the number of births in Portugal during the same period. You can easily spot this by adding a trend line.

To build this line chart you need to:

    Remove the reference line you created before.
    Add a linear trend line for the number of births over time.

This exercise builds upon what you created in the previous exercise. If you lost progress, load the workbook 3_11_Trend_lines.twbx from the Workbooks folder on the Desktop.
