Ratio between gender

Another useful calculated field to make is ratio. Ratios are a good way to compare two values. In our case, we can compare the mean years of education between women and men using a ratio. The closer the ratio is to one, the more equal levels of education are between women and men.

    Load the 2_7_Ratio_between_gender.twbx workbook (located in the Workbooks folder on the Desktop).
    Create a calculated field called Men:Women (25-34) which calculates the men:women ratio for years spent in school in the 25-34 age group.
    Add this new field as a column to the table by dragging it to the Text card.

Using sorting on your view, answer the following question.

Which G20 country has the lowest men:women (25-34) ratio for years spent in school?
Brazil
