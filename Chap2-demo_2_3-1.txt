CO2 Emissions and GDP in Sub Regions

In this exercise, you are going to create a scatter plot comparing GDP per Capita and CO2 Emmissions per Person. The data points in the scatter plot should represent Sub Regions (unlike the demo, where we used Country).

   Load the 2_8_CO2_Emissions_and_GDP_in_Sub_Regions.twbx workbook (located in the Workbooks folder on the Desktop).


Based on your scatter plot, which of the following statements is true?
