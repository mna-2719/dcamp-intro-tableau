Filtering for null values

We want to know for which countries we lack values for the measures Cell Phones per 100 people and Broadband Subscribers per 100 people.

    Load the 2_3_Filtering_for_null_values.twbx workbook (located in the Workbooks folder on the Desktop).
    Use the filter functionality to filter the measures for null values.
